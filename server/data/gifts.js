        "description":"A Skill dependent matchup, can take TP vs some teamfight heavy comps, but usually ignite. Hold W post 6 if as she will all in you with as soon as you misplace it. You wanna win pre-6 and snowball otherwise hard to kill her when she rushes zhonyas and holds E for when you engage with R on her or ADC."

        "description":"She WILL poke you down, just accept that you can't kill her pre-6, especially when she goes bone plating and D shield first buy like a little biatch. Try to farm under turret as best you can and pray. You can kill her post 6 if you dodge her R with your R, but she will just jump away and you will have to flash for the kill."

        "description":"Skill dependent, I personally like conqueror but you can go electrocute as well. Annoying thing about the matchup is his dashes and he greatly outsustains you with fleet footwork and just his passive shield. You can kill him pre-6 if you dodge his Q's and E's and you can kill him post 6 if you dodge his R with your R. Be careful when you R tho as he can hold his tornado for when you spawn back in, it's all a mind game."

        "description":"REALLY easy, just poke him down whenever ur W is up and prob kill him level 4 honestly, he's really squishy at the start. Just dodge gold card with R and make sure you follow his roams when possible. TP in this matchup sounds good but maintain pressure with ignite."
